## Description
Brainroll is a sokoban inspired puzzle game where the main mechanic is that you slide on ice, making you take several steps instead of a single step each turn. This game is my first game and was created with the goal to ship a fully finished commercial game in the handmade spirit. It took be about 2 years of working on average 2 hours per day after my day job to finish it.
